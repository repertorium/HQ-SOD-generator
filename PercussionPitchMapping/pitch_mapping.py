'''
This module uses the PrettyMIDI library to remap the MIDI pitch value
for each note of untuned percussion instruments.
The remapping ensures that pitches align with the valid values of the
Spitfire BBC Symphony Orchestra Synthesizer, as specified in the
`valid_pitches.yaml` file.

Different sets of valid MIDI pitches are considered based on the
untuned percussion instrument, identified by the MIDI CC#32 value within
every single MIDI file from the database.

The remapping is performed by shifting the MIDI pitches octave-wise so
they lay within the valid range of pitches for each one of the instruments.
